## ðŸ”„ Why Nodemon?

Normally, if we run our server with `node`, every time we make changes in code, we have to **manually restart** the server.

- Whenever you make changes, it **automatically restarts** the server.
- Productivity boost âœ….

### Installation

- **Global installation**
  ```bash
  npm install -g nodemon
  ```
