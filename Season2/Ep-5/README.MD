## 🔹 What is Middleware?

👉 **Middleware** is simply a **function that sits between the request and the response**. It can **modify, validate, log, authenticate, or even stop the request** before it reaches the final handler.

📌 **Flow:**

```
Client → Middleware Chain → Request Handler → Response
```

### Why do we need middleware?

- Logging (who hit our server?)
- Authentication / Authorization
- Error handling
- Data parsing (JSON, body, etc.)
- Reusability (plug and play anywhere 🚀)

## 🔹 Route Handlers

A **route handler** is the **final function** in the chain that actually **sends the response to the client**.

👉 In Express:

```javascript
app.get("/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World 🚀");
});
```

## 🔹 Multiple Route Handlers

We can attach **multiple handlers** to the same route, either:

- **Comma separated**
- **As an array**

```javascript
function rh1(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Handler 1");
  next();
}

function rh2(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Handler 2");
  res.send("Final Response ✅");
}

app.get("/test", rh1, rh2);
```

👉 Both ways (`rh1, rh2` or `[rh1, rh2]`) work the same.

## 🔹 The `next()` Function

- `next()` is used to **pass control to the next middleware/handler** in the chain.
- If you don't call `next()` and don't send a response → request hangs ⏳ (infinite waiting).

⚠️ **Important Rule**: If you send a response (`res.send()`) in one handler and again try to send another response in the next handler → **Express will throw an error**.

👉 **Why?**

- Because once the client **receives the response**, the **socket connection closes**.
- Sending again means **headers are already sent** → Express shouts: _"Can't set headers after they are sent!"_

## 🔹 How Express Handles Requests (Behind the Scenes)

- Express checks routes **top to bottom**.
- It matches the **first route** that fits and then executes its **middleware chain**.
- If no response is sent → it keeps going down until something sends a response.
- If still no response → request hangs 🌀

👉 **Example Flow:**

```
GET /user
   ↓
Middlewares (auth, logger, etc.)
   ↓
Request Handler
   ↓
Response sent ✅
```

## 🔹 Status Codes

Every response has a **status code**:

- `200` → Success
- `201` → Resource Created
- `400` → Bad Request
- `401` → Unauthorized
- `404` → Not Found
- `500` → Server Error

👉 **Example:**

```javascript
res.status(201).send("User Created 🎉");
```

## 🔹 app.use() vs app.all()

- **`app.use(path, middleware)`**

  - Runs for **all HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Example: authentication, logging.

- **`app.all(path, handler)`**
  - Matches **all HTTP methods** but only for **that specific path**.
  - Example: a `/maintenance` route that blocks all requests.

## 🔹 Error Handling in Express

Express has a **special middleware** for error handling:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something broke 💥");
});
```

✅ Always put error handlers **at the bottom** of your code, because Express executes middleware in order.

## 🔹 Real-World Analogy 🍴

Think of a **restaurant**:

- **Customer (Client)** → places order (request).
- **Waiter (Middleware)** → takes order, checks token (auth), notes allergies (validation).
- **Chef (Request Handler)** → prepares food (response).
- **Manager (Error Handler)** → if kitchen burns food 🍳🔥 → apologizes and offers compensation.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Middleware** = functions that process requests before final response.
- **Route Handler** = function that sends the response.
- `next()` passes control to the next middleware.
- **Never send multiple responses**.
- **app.use() vs app.all()** → global middleware vs path-specific all-methods.
- **Error handler** = always at the bottom.

🔥 **That's the backbone of Express middleware & error handling.**
